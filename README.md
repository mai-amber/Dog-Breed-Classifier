# Dog-Breed-Classifier

## Motivation
So usually determining whether a given image is a human or a dog isn't too big of a challenge, but then again determining which kind of dog you're looking at can be! That's precisely what this project aimed to solve.

## Project Definition
This project is the capstone of the Udacity data science nanodegree. The aim was to create a program that chooses a dog breed when shown a dog, and points to the most similar dog breed when shown a human.

## Repository files
The repository includes:

1. A Jupyter notebook of the project code
2. The dog dataset
3. The human dataset

The second requirement of the project is a blog post, this is the link: 

## Analysis

My CNN from scratch got an accuracy of above 5%

My CNN using ResNet50 gave a final accuracy of after 25 epochs

## Conclusion

The classifier successfully achieves the objectives of the project and provides a solution to the problem of classifying dogs into breeds (and humans into breeds of most similarity)
